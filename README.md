This project provides a template for developing Telegram bots using Python. It includes a structured setup with:

    Aiogram: A modern and easy-to-use framework for Telegram bot development.
    
    SQLAlchemy: An ORM (Object Relational Mapper) for database management.
    
    Alembic: A lightweight database migration tool.
    
    Docker: Containerization to ensure consistency and ease of deployment.

This template aims to streamline the development process, offering a solid foundation for building and scaling Telegram bots efficiently.
